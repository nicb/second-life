# *The real "Second Life"*

![CC BY-SA](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)

A book on the *second life* theory.

## Disclaimer

Please note: this theory has nothing to do with the virtual reality game/site
[Second Life](http://secondlife.com/) and it is not related nor connect to the
latter in any form. We're not talking about a *parallel* form of life that you
imagine virtually while living the *real* one, but rather about the
*subsequent serial* life that you live *for real* **after** living the first one.
However, the theory has nothing to do with life-after-death, to be sure: it is
life *after* life, rather.
