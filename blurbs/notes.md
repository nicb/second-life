# _The Second Life_ - notes

## Abstract

Our biological programming takes care of our life. We are born to put up a
family in a monogamous relationship: marry, procreate children, cater for
their needs, grow them up, and die when they are old enough to do this very
same thing again.

In this context, a number of deviations from the normal biological (and
zoological, cf. Morris) take place: 

* polygamy (power display)
* other relations (usually hidden)
* polyandry (rare)

This has been true up until the end of the industrial era.
Technological developments have led the life expectation to progressively
increase up to the double of the biologically programmed (and still growing).
So basically, when we are finished with our _first life_ (let's say -
hipotetically - within our first 50 years), then a whole new _entire_ life
begins. This life, however, has two fundamental problems:

1. It's a life in which we're already old and growing older
1. The purpose of our actions is completely cultural (no nature is involved in
   it)

Our _second life_ needs then to be completely re-thought and refactored.
Thinking in the old fashioned way - that of the _first life_ - may lead to
unsatisfaction, depression and, in the end, a bad elderly age. Succeding in
our reflection may lead, on the contrary, to an interesting and fulfilling
life under each and every aspect of it.
